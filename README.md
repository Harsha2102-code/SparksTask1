Prediction Using Supervised ML
Dataset is of 2 columns hours of study and score.both are correlated.
In this we need to fit a linear Regression model and we have to predict the score for 9.25hr/day study.
in this data is visualized using matplotlib.
Conclusions are drawn based R^2(,mse,mae,rmse for model accuracy).
